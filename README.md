# Yoga Class Admission Form System.



Yoga Class Admission Form System's goal is to streamline the admission process, making it seamless for both participants and administrators. This admission form is specifically crafted to cater to the unique requirements of our Yoga classes, ensuring a smooth enrollment experience for individuals seeking to embark on a journey towards wellness.

## System Overview
The Yoga Class Admission Form System encompasses the following key features:

Age Limit Restriction: Participants must fall within the age range of 18 to 65 to enroll in the monthly classes.

Flexible Payment Structure: Fees are payable on a month-to-month basis, allowing participants to choose their convenient time within the month for payment. The fixed monthly fee is set at 500/- Rs INR.

Batch Selection: Participants can choose one of the four available batches per day, namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM, and 5-6PM. While participants have the flexibility to switch batches every month, they are required to remain in the same batch throughout a given month.
